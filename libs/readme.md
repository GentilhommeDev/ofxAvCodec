This is where the FFmpeg binaries live. This particular binary is licensed under the lgpl, which grants you a whole lot of rights (the full license can be found in avcodec/LICENSE.md). The most important one being that you can modify the FFmpeg/libavcodec source code and create your own version. 

If you would like to do so, please see the `../ffmpeg_src/` directory. It contains information how to obtain the source code, how to compile the binaries for yourself, and how to replace the binaries included here.
